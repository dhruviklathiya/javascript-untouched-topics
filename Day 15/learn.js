// navigator.hardwareConcurrency (CPU Cores Detection)
// Useful for performance optimization

console.log(navigator.hardwareConcurrency);

// This JavaScript code utilizes the `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` property to detect and log the number of logical CPU cores available on the user's device.
// By accessing this value, developers can gain insight into the hardware capabilities of the user's machine, which is particularly useful for optimizing performance in web applications.
// For example, it allows for smarter allocation of resources, such as determining how many Web Workers to spawn for parallel processing. Logging this value to the console provides a quick way to assess system capabilities and tailor application behavior accordingly.
